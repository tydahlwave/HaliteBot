DONE - Get average production rate of all nodes on map
prefer nodes with > average production rate
Prefer nodes with less strength

DONE - Get total production rate of my nodes
DONE - Get total power of my nodes this frame

Prefer enemy nodes to neutral nodes

Only combine with one of my nodes if it wont overflow past 255 strength
else combine with smaller nearby node (maybe)

Prefer closer nodes

If my total production rate is 

DONE - Set isInCombat to true if any of my nodes are adjacent to any enemy nodes
- iterate through entire map, for each node, compare with bottom and right neighbors
- if current is my node, check bot and right for if they are enemy
- if current is enemy node, check bot and right for if they are mine
- if true, set isInCombat to true, store position in list of combat positions

If isInCombat, focus resources toward nearest combat positions
- nodes that are farther than 20 away from any combat position can expand

If expanding, direction toward best node = production*2 + 1/power + 1/distance(upto10) + enemy/5

Pathfinding
- get node to move toward
- 









TO FIX:
- Pathfinding
- Don't allow moves to the same location if they will reduce strength
- Implement combat mode
-
